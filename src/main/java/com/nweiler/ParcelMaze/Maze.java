/**
 * For our game "The Parcel Maze of Doom!" navigation through the maze is strictly text based.
 * Meaning, that when you want to go from one room to another it is based on the players
 * input of direction. Similar to Zuul when a player wants to move they have the option 
 * of direction. (North, South, East, West)
 * 
 * Unlike Zuul, however, our game will have unique images displayed for each room 
 * In addition to that the player could wander into a room that has a monster or a parcel. 
 * Encountering a monster initiates a fight sequence.
 * A parcel increases the player's health.
